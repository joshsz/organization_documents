# DCRUG Code Of Conduct v1.0

**All people who choose to be a part of our community are required to agree with the following code of conduct.** This includes longtime members, newbies, friends who come along to events, sponsors, and organizers.

DCRUG is dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of personal attributes such as gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof), or any other intrinsic characteristic that makes us who we are.

We expect everyone to help create a safe, positive, and welcoming environment for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment is the expression of ideas, through actions or words, intended or known to shame, intimidate, or harm another person. Harassment hurts people, and by extension destroys communities.

Harassment may include, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to any of those intrinsic characteristics by which we define our humanity, the display of sexually explicit images, deliberate physical intimidation, stalking,  photography or recording without consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

This code of conduct applies to any of our community interactions, including at meetups, on meetup.com, on our mailing list, on our forums, or any other DCRUG-sanctioned event or space.

If you have been or are being harassed by a member of the community, please contact one of the organizers either in person or through info@dcrug.org. We commit to taking swift action including up to expelling the offender from DCRUG and calling relevant authorities as needed. If a complaint is about an organizer, another organizer will resolve the complaint.

Our community has been around for a long time so we base this code on trusting each other.

We hope this Code of Conduct helps everyone understand we expect DCRUG to be a safe space for the DC-area Ruby Community to share amazing things with each other and help each other learn, grow, and succeed.
