# DCRUG Code Of Conduct v1.0

DCRUG is dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of personal attributes such as gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to any of our community interactions, including at meetups, on [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/), on our mailing list, on our forums, or any other DCRUG-sanctioned event or space.

If you have been or are being harassed by a member of the community, please contact one of the organizers either in person or through info@dcrug.org. We commit to taking swift action including up to expelling the offender from DCRUG and calling relevant authorities as needed.
If a complaint is about an organizer, another organizer will resolve the complaint.

Our community has been around for a long time so we base this code on trusting each other.
We define harassment broadly and will take relevant action as needed.
Examples of unacceptable behavior include personal attacks, unethical or unprofessional conduct, or the use of sexualized language or imagery.

We hope this Code of Conduct helps everyone understand we expect DCRUG to be a safe space for the DC-area Ruby Community to share amazing things with each other and help each other learn, grow, and succeed.
